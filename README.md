## Executive Summary

The AI-Powered Resume Screening System is a comprehensive solution designed to optimize the recruitment process by automating candidate evaluation through advanced natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. The system analyzes resumes against job descriptions, ranks candidates based on skill matching and professional experience, and provides detailed insights to recruiters while maintaining fairness and transparency.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Processing Layer
- **Resume Parser**: Utilizes BERT-based NLP to extract structured information from various resume formats
- **Job Description Analyzer**: Transforms requirements into structured skills and qualification vectors
- **Skill Extraction Engine**: Employs spaCy-based Named Entity Recognition to identify and categorize candidate skills

### 2. Matching Engine
- **Semantic Skill Matching**: Uses BERT embeddings and cosine similarity to match skills beyond keyword matching
- **Experience Evaluator**: Analyzes project relevance and industry experience
- **XGBoost Ranking Algorithm**: Generates composite scores based on multiple weighted factors

### 3. Interface Layer
- **Candidate Ranking Dashboard**: Visualizes top candidates with match percentages
- **Detailed Analysis Reports**: Provides comprehensive breakdown of candidate qualifications
- **Resume Optimization Insights**: Generates improvement suggestions for candidates

### 4. Ethical AI Components
- **Bias Detection Module**: Leverages AIF360 and Fairlearn to identify and mitigate bias
- **Explainable AI Engine**: Provides transparency into ranking decisions using SHAP
